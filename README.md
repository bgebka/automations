# automations
This space showcases my automation skills through a series of tasks that I have automated. You can get a quick idea of my automation abilities by watching the short screen recordings provided. For web scraping tasks, I use UI Vision, while n8n and Postman are my go-to tools for calling APIs. I also utilize Apple Script to automatically trigger certain automations and webhooks.

In the API.ClosedCompaniesCheck.Results copie.mov.zip recording, I demonstrate how I fetch data from an official government API and use it to fill my own Gsheets file. In the Auditing_regcodes.mov recording, I use UI Vision to automate an operational task. Finally, in the Automation.Webhook_to_n8n_workflow.daily.mov recording, I show how I trigger an automation using Apple Script and create a webhook.
